This image dataset provides a benchmark for systematic evaluation of robustness to viewpoint change of the image matching algorithms such as SIFT. The dataset contains two  
parts: one for absolute tilt test and other for transition tilt test. The transition tilt is a new notion that measures the amount of distortion from one view to another [Morel  
and Yu 09]. It gives a fair and new evaluation criterion of the affine invariance of classic algorithms. 

Some test examples are available at http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~yu/research/ASIFT/demo.html where the state-of-the-arts image matching algorithms SIFT, MSER, Harris-Affine and Hessian-Affine are compared with Affine-SIFT (ASIFT), a new fully affine invariant image comparison method [Morel and Yu 09]. 

About the dataset:
- "Absolute Tilt Tests" contains 3 sets of images: a painting is photographed with optical zoom x1 and x10; a magazine is photographed with optical zoom x4. An image in frontal  
viewed and 8 in slanted view with the angles from 10 to 80 degrees are available for each set. Note that a strong perspective effect is presented under zoom x1. 

- "Transition Tilt Tests" contains 2 sets of images: a magazine is photographed with respectively absolute tilts 2 and 4. The longitude angle varies from 0 to 90 degrees which  
results in the transition tilt respectively from 1 to 4 and to 16. 

For more information about the dataset, see [Morel and Yu 09].
